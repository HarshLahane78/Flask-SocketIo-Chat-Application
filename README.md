## 1. Introduction

This Flask-SocketIO chat application provides a real-time messaging platform that utilizes rooms for user-to-user communication. The app handles messaging via WebSocket events, specifically using join_room and leave_room, and the backend logic is driven by GET and POST HTTP methods. This application does not use SQLite or any other SQL database, making it lightweight and easy to set up.

## 2. Features

- *Real-time Communication*: Leverages Flask-SocketIO for real-time messaging.
- *Room-Based Chat*: Users can join or leave rooms to have private or group conversations.
- *Terminal Output*: All messages and events are logged to the terminal for easy monitoring.
- *No Database Dependency*: The application runs without SQL databases, storing data in-memory.

## 3. Technologies Used

- *Python*
- *Flask*: A micro web framework for Python.
- *Flask-SocketIO*: Enables WebSocket communication in Flask.
- *Werkzeug*: Provides utilities for password hashing.
- *eventlet or gevent*: For managing long-lived connections.
- *HTML/CSS/JavaScript*: For the front-end interface.

## 4. Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- A virtual environment (recommended).

### Installation Steps

1. *Clone the Repository*:
   bash
   https://github.com/HarshLahane78/Flask-Socketio-Chat-Application.git
   
   bash
   cd flask-socketio-chat
   

2. *Set Up a Virtual Environment*:
   bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   
   Source:
   bash
   venv/bin/activate
   
   On Windows:
   bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   

3. *Install Dependencies*:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

4. *Run the Application*:
   bash
   flask run
   

The application should now be running at [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).

## 5. User-to-User Communication Protocol

### Room-Based Communication

- *Rooms*: Each chat room is identified by a unique name. Users can join or leave rooms, enabling private or group conversations.
- *Messaging*: Messages are sent to specific rooms using SocketIO, ensuring they are only delivered to users in that room.

### Protocol Details

1. *User Joins a Room*:
   - The client emits a join event, which the server handles by adding the user to the room.
   - The server confirms the join and notifies other users in the room.

2. *User Sends a Message*:
   - The client sends a POST request to the server, which is then emitted as a message event to the relevant room.
   - The message is broadcast to all users in the room and logged in the terminal.

3. *User Leaves a Room*:
   - The client emits a leave event, which the server handles by removing the user from the room.
   - The server confirms the leave and notifies other users in the room.

## 6. Usage

### Starting the Application

To start the chat application:
bash
flask run


Access the application via your web browser at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### Sending Messages

- *Join a Room*: Select or create a room to join.
- *Send a Message*: Type your message in the chat box and hit send.
- *Leave a Room*: Click on the leave button to exit a room.

All actions are reflected in the terminal, providing real-time feedback for developers.

## 7. Application Architecture

### Overview

- *Main Application (app.py)*: Handles the Flask setup, routes, and SocketIO events.
- *SocketIO Events*: Manage real-time communication, allowing users to join and leave rooms.
- *Templates (/templates)*: Contains the HTML files for the user interface.

## 8. Password Security

For added security, each chat room is protected by a password that is randomly generated using Python's random module when the room is created. The password is shared only with the room creator, who can then distribute it to other users.<br>

### How It Works

1. *Password Generation*:
   - When a user creates a new room, a random password is generated using a combination of alphanumeric characters.
   - This password is stored in memory and returned to the room creator.

2. *Password Verification*:
   - Users attempting to join a room must provide the correct password.
   - The server checks the provided password against the stored password for that room.
   - Only users with the correct password are allowed to join the room.
